# SUPERTATETI


## Description

It is a virtual version of the Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe board game. The rules of the game can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tic-tac-toe.

In March 2020, as soon as the pandemic started, I was giving my first steps in college. During this period, I decided to code this game to entertain myself. Initially, the objective was to create a platform for human-to-human gameplay, as I had frequently enjoyed playing this game on paper during high school. Subsequently, I learned about the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm and applied it to this game, thereby creating an artificial intelligence capable of engaging in strategic gameplay. This project which was one of my first programming projects then led me to create the "Azul" project which was much more complex.

This initiative not only served as a means of personal enjoyment but also contributed to my understanding and application of advanced algorithms in a practical setting.

In June 2020 I launched a competition between my Instagram followers to see if anyone could beat my AI, offering a small fun prize to the winner, but nobody was able to beat it.
